# JS_Hof-1
Higher order functions (HOFs) in JavaScript are functions that function as a parameter
This repository contains solutions to various JavaScript problems that focus on manipulating and analyzing data in arrays. The solutions demonstrate the use of key array methods such as .map(), .filter(), and .reduce().

Problems and Explanations
1. Count Unique Strings
Problem: Given an array of strings, the goal is to create an object that counts the occurrences of each unique string. This helps in understanding the frequency of elements within the array.

2. Sum of Multiples of 3 or 5
Problem: For an array of numbers, this task requires calculating the sum of all numbers that are divisible by either 3 or 5. This problem is commonly encountered in coding challenges and emphasizes working with conditions and accumulations.

3. Filter Palindromes
Problem: The objective is to return an array containing only the strings that read the same forwards and backwards, known as palindromes. This problem illustrates the use of string manipulation and conditional checks.

4. Filter Image Files
Problem: From an array of file paths, the goal is to extract only those paths that have either a .png or .jpg extension. This demonstrates filtering based on specific criteria.

5. Swap First and Last Letters
Problem: This task involves creating a new array where each string has its first and last letters swapped. It showcases how to manipulate string characters and form new strings based on specific positions.

6. Log Word Count
Problem: For an array of sentences, the challenge is to log the number of words in each sentence. This emphasizes text processing and counting operations.

7. Sum of Squares of Odd Numbers
Problem: Given an array of numbers, the task is to find the sum of the squares of all odd numbers. This involves filtering the odd numbers, squaring them, and then summing the results, which illustrates the combination of multiple array methods.

Usage
To use the solutions:

Clone the repository and run the functions in a JavaScript environment, such as Node.js or a browser console.
Modify the input data as needed to test with different scenarios.
